Function	             Description
mul(a, b)	             Multiplies a and b and returns the result. This function is useful when you wish to multiply matrix variables with other values. Otherwise using the usual * operator will do just fine. The parameters can be scalar, vector or matrix variables.
pow(base, exponent)      Returns the base raised to the given exponent.
tan(A)	                 Returns the tangent of the given angle, in radians.
sin(A)	                 Returns the sine of the given angle, in radians.
cos(A)	                 Returns the cosine of the given angle, in radians.
sqrt(a)	                 Returns the squareroot of the given value.
round(a)	             Rounds the given value to the nearest integer.
saturate(a)	             Forces the given value to be between 0 and 1. Returns the new value and keeps the original unchanged.
degrees(A)	             Converts the given angle from radians to degrees.
radians(A)	             Converts the given angle from degrees to radians.
min(a, b)	             Returns the smaller of a and b.
max(a, b)	             Returns the larger of a and b.
